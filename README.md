# OGLBubbles
An OpenGL project that, when in its final stages, should render bubbles.

Currently has some major flaws, so if you're reading this and thinking you want to add to my pet project... you should probably wait a month.
There are likely many errors with how I set up the CMake project, included the libraries and set up the compiler.

Oh well! Eventually it'll be pretty cool, maybe I'll even make it use Vulkan once I get the bubbles up.
